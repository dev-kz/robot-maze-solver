# robot-maze-solver
A team project where we developed the source code for an EV3 robot using Robot C language.

### Motivation:
Program a robot to complete tasks.

### Objective:
Make a robot solve a maze problem by finding boxes and stacking them on top of each other throughout the maze.

### Video demo:

### Limitations:
1. Limited set of EV3 robot pieces.
2. The coordinates of the maze were hardcoded because the shape of the maze never changed.
3. The unique coordinates of the boxes were inputed before starting the application.

### Improvements:
The source code can be improved to be more clear and concise.
